## Notes

- What is welfare
	- Govt. programs that alleviate economic hardship (disabled, poor, elderly, etc.)
	- Paid through govt transfers (payments from govt to individuals/families)
- Usage of welfare state
	- Welfare system helps w/ 3 basic problems
		- Income inequality: what's extra dollar worth to wealthy vs poor?
			- Can redistribution raise well-being?
		- Economic insecurity: people feel safer when they have a safety net (i.e. social programs)
		- Benefits of reduced poverty + access to health care
			- Kids out of poverty --> reduced crime, higher employment
- Poverty
	- Assign a household income value based on # of members
	- Household is below threshold --> "in poverty"
	- Family of 4 in the US has poverty line of $27,750
- Trends in poverty
	- Supplemental poverty rate
		- Includes cash and non-cash benefits + subtracts necessary benefits (i.e. taxes + medical expenses)
	- Official poverty rate
		- Based on cash resources
- What drives poverty?
	- Education matters --> wages are 82% higher on avg for college vs HS grads
	- Race + gender bias
	- Health care costs
- Consequences of poverty
	- Growing up in poverty can last through the life cycle
		- Poorer kids are less likely to finish HS and college
		- Education + salary of kids often rely on education + salary of parents
		- Women whose families receive welfare during childhood = 3 times more likely to be on welfare as adults
- Poverty in the US
  ![[Pasted image 20231003123406.png]]
	- 2 relevant measures of income - mean and median
- US has high poverty rate despite high mean income
	- Due to skewed income distribution + Gini coefficient
		- Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion which represents income inequality
			- Ranges from 0 (perfect equality, equal shares) to 1 (perfect inequality)
			- Gini coefficient calculation = `A / (A + B)`
			  ![[Pasted image 20231003123653.png]]
			- Ex: Gini coefficient can be lowered by taxing high-income individuals to pay for pre-k education programs
				- Policy could improve social mobility + remove income disparities
- Gini across the world ![[Pasted image 20231003124237.png]]
	- Scandinavian countries --> low Gini, South Africa --> very high Gini
- Inequality over time
	- Growth was consistent across quantiles before 1980
	- Since 1980 higher income groups' growth has been growing more
	- Bad because countries w/ greater inequality --> more politically + economically unstable
- Why the growth in inequality?
	- Changes in return to education + technology (efficiency reasons)
	- Immigration affects education groups differently
		- Most immigrants have low education --> depress low-skill wages more
	- Outsourcing impacts education groups differently
		- Manufacturing is high paying, but US lost lots of its manufacturing jobs
- Major programs in the US
	- Programs broken down by 2 characteristics
		- Means-tested vs not
			- Means-tested: limits eligibility to those whose incomes/assets fall below threshold
			- Not means-tested: Income/capital are not considered
		- In-kind vs monetary
			- In-kind: benefits that are not cash (i.e. shelter, utilities, food, etc.)
			- Monetary: cash benefits
	- Table of programs + classification ![[Pasted image 20231003162136.png]]
- Social security + unemployment
	- Both monetary, neither means-tested
	- Social security: transfer of wealth b/w working + non-working population
		- Anti-poverty aspect - 20% elderly entire income is SS, 60% at least half
	- Unemployment: provides support structure for workers who lose their jobs
		- Initially 35% of prior income for 26 wks
		- Expanded in total value + applicable time during pandemic
		- Funded by tax on employers
- SSI, TANF, EITC 
	- All means-tested, monetary transfers
	- SSI (Supplemental Security Income)
		- Helps disabled children + adults
	- TANF (Temporary Aid to Needy Families)
		- Additional income for poor families
		- Requires people be working / looking for work + has time limits
	- EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit)
		- Provides tax rebates, effectively raising wage
- Food stamps and medical
	- SNAP / Food Stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)
		- Means-tested, in-kind
	- Medicaid
		- Means-tested, in-kind
		- Largely run by states, cutoff varies by state
		- Income cutoff expanded due to Affordable Care Act, but some resistant
	- Medicare
		- Not means-tested, in-kind
		- Has some premium adjustments by income
	- Question: For which of the following can one use SNAP benefits?
	  (a) Vitamins
	  (b) Frozen pizza
	  (c) A fresh rotisserie chicken
	  (d) All of the above
		- Frozen pizza
		  Explanation: SNAP cannot be used to by vitamins/medicines, so (a) is false. SNAP can be used to buy frozen pizzas, so (b) is true. SNAP can be used to buy poultry, but a fresh rotisserie chicken is likely not allowed to be purchased, so (c) is false. Since (a) and (c) are false, (d) is false. Thus, frozen pizza, which is (b) is the right answer. 
- Health care in the US
	- US govt plays a role, but far less than other developed countries
		- Medicare, Medicaid subsidies for private health care payments
	- Much of medical coverage in US is private companies
	- Risk pooling is how private healthcare insurance works
		- Allows higher costs of unhealthy to be offset by the lower costs of healthy
	- Employer-based insurance spreads risk over employees in firm
		- Govt subsidizes - employer contr. is removed from income + payroll taxes
- Adverse selection vs moral hazard
	- Adverse selection: people with different risk profiles make choices based on their risk
	- Moral hazard: phenomenon that having insurance may change one's behavior
- Stagflation
	- Economy experiences stagnant growth, high unemployment, and high inflation
- The "Death Spiral"
	- Risk pooling can go wrong due to adverse selection
	- Example: ![[Pasted image 20231004021937.png]]
		- If Person 1 leaves, insurance cost jumps to 5k
		- Adverse selection results - individuals w/ higher risk buy insurance, while lower risk don't
		- Causes imbalance in pool, driving up costs for company + premiums
- Govt health care in the US
	- Many not covered by private insurance fall under govt insurance
	- Medicare
		- Available for > 65, no income cutoff
	- Medicaid
		- Means tested, covers many poor children
	- Despite programs still tens of millions of elderly were uninsured in US
- Uninsured
	- Majority are low-income, part-time workers without work insurance
	- Many children covered by SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program)
		- Provides help for low-income, above poverty-line families
	- Problematic for adults, particularly those without children
		- Not always a poverty issue --> many uninsured above poverty line
	- Problems with uninsured
		- Medical care can be very expensive
		- Use emergency room for non-emergency care - very inefficient + costly
- Health care reform
	- Health care costs are rising
	- Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)
		- Increases insurance coverage + controls cost expansion
			- Offered Federal $ (90% of costs) to states that expanded Medicaid qualification to 137% of the poverty line
			- ACA set up "exchanges" where people could compare private policies
- Increasing coverage
	- Problem w/ old system is denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions
		- Companies deny to keep risk pool balanced
	- Solution: (1) firms sell to everyone
		- Adverse selection issue - healthy ppl will not buy due to high costs
		- (2) make it illegal not to have insurance (type of individual mandate)
			- Prevents healthy from not buying --> solves risk problem
			- Can't afford --> (3) subsidize for low-income people
- The ACA (Obamacare) historically
	- Expanded coverage was a major success - 20 mil uninsured now have coverage
	- Eliminated price differences across groups (can't charge diff rates by sex now)
	- Market costs were high at first
		- Few healthy ppl signed up
		- Children stayed on parent's plan until 26 --> they can't buy individually
			- Both led to companies losing money, dropping out ... less competition --> higher prices
	- How to fix high market cost issue?
		- Some say single-payer (govt health care), others more competition
- Big picture welfare challenges
	- How much welfare should we provide? We must pay for this via taxes
	- Taxes cause DWL + higher tax rates --> negative incentives for work
		- Ppl are less likely to work/invest/etc. if marginal earnings go to taxes
	- Means-tested programs have issues 
		- Removing welfare aid puts high tax rate on poor earning more
		- Notch: pt where small income change --> large change in welfare benefits
