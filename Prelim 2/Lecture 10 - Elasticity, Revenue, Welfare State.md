## Notes
#### Reminder: Elasticity and Revenue
- Elasticity across the demand curve
  ![[Pasted image 20231003033604.png]]
	- Elastic/inelastic and quantity of demand
		- Elastic: quantity demand of product changes more than proportionally when price increases/decreases
		- Inelastic: quantity of demand changes very little
		- Unit elastic: % change in price = % change in demand
- Elasticity rules (**E - elasticity, PE - price equilibrium, QE - quantity equilibrium**) 
	- E < 1 (inelastic) --> | PE | > | QE |
		- P increases --> revenue increases, P decreases --> revenue decreases
		- P, revenue move together
	- E > 1 (elastic) --> | PE | < | QE |
		- P increases --> revenue decreases, P decreases --> revenue increases
		- P, revenue move in opposite directions
	- E = 1 (unit elastic) --> | PE | = | QE |
		- P increases, decreases --> revenue unchanged
	- Linear demand curves
		- E starts above 1 at lower Q, crosses 1, then goes below 1 at higher Q
- Total revenue calculation example
	- Between points A and B
	  ![[Pasted image 20231003120137.png]]
		- Original TR is given by area of boxes x1, x2: `8 * 2 = 16`
		- New TR is given by area of boxes x2, x3: `6 * 4 = 24`
		- `24 > 16`, so as price ↑ revenue ↓ --> elastic (E starts above 1 at lower Q)
	- Between points C and D
	  ![[Pasted image 20231003120631.png]]
		- Original TR is given by area of boxes x1, x2: `4 * 6 = 24`
		- New TR is given by area of boxes x2, x3: `2 * 8 = 16` (rev. ↓ by $8)
		- `16 < 24`, so as price ↓ revenue ↓ --> inelastic (E goes below 1 at higher Q)
#### The Welfare State
- What is welfare
	- Govt. programs that alleviate economic hardship (disabled, poor, elderly, etc.)
	- Paid through govt transfers (payments from govt to individuals/families)
- Usage of welfare state
	- Welfare system helps w/ 3 basic problems
		- Income inequality: what's extra dollar worth to wealthy vs poor?
			- Can redistribution raise well-being?
		- Economic insecurity: people feel safer when they have a safety net (i.e. social programs)
		- Benefits of reduced poverty + access to health care
			- Kids out of poverty --> reduced crime, higher employment
- Poverty
	- Assign a household income value based on # of members
	- Household is below threshold --> "in poverty"
	- Family of 4 in the US has poverty line of $27,750
- Trends in poverty
	- Supplemental poverty rate
		- Includes cash and non-cash benefits + subtracts necessary benefits (i.e. taxes + medical expenses)
	- Official poverty rate
		- Based on cash resources
- What drives poverty?
	- Education matters --> wages are 82% higher on avg for college vs HS grads
	- Race + gender bias
	- Health care costs
- Consequences of poverty
	- Growing up in poverty can last through the life cycle
		- Poorer kids are less likely to finish HS and college
		- Education + salary of kids often rely on education + salary of parents
		- Women whose families receive welfare during childhood = 3 times more likely to be on welfare as adults
- Poverty in the US
  ![[Pasted image 20231003123406.png]]
	- 2 relevant measures of income - mean and median
- US has high poverty rate despite high mean income
	- Due to skewed income distribution + Gini coefficient
		- Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion which represents income inequality
			- Ranges from 0 (perfect equality, equal shares) to 1 (perfect inequality)
			- Gini coefficient calculation = `A / (A + B)`
			  ![[Pasted image 20231003123653.png]]
			- Ex: Gini coefficient can be lowered by taxing high-income individuals to pay for pre-k education programs
				- Policy could improve social mobility + remove income disparities
- Gini across the world ![[Pasted image 20231003124237.png]]
	- Scandinavian countries --> low Gini, South Africa --> very high Gini
- Inequality over time
	- Growth was consistent across quantiles before 1980
	- Since 1980 higher income groups' growth has been growing more
	- Bad because countries w/ greater inequality --> more politically + economically unstable
- Why the growth in inequality?
	- Changes in return to education + technology (efficiency reasons)
	- Immigration affects education groups differently
		- Most immigrants have low education --> depress low-skill wages more
	- Outsourcing impacts education groups differently
		- Manufacturing is high paying, but US lost lots of its manufacturing jobs
- Major programs in the US
	- Programs broken down by 2 characteristics
		- Means-tested vs not
			- Means-tested: limits eligibility to those whose incomes/assets fall below threshold
			- Not means-tested: Income/capital are not considered
		- In-kind vs monetary
			- In-kind: benefits that are not cash (i.e. shelter, utilities, food, etc.)
			- Monetary: cash benefits
	- Table of programs + classification ![[Pasted image 20231003162136.png]]
- Social security + unemployment
	- Both monetary, neither means-tested
	- Social security: transfer of wealth b/w working + non-working population
		- Anti-poverty aspect - 20% elderly entire income is SS, 60% at least half
	- Unemployment: provides support structure for workers who lose their jobs
		- Initially 35% of prior income for 26 wks
		- Expanded in total value + applicable time during pandemic
		- Funded by tax on employers
- SSI, TANF, EITC 
	- All means-tested, monetary transfers
	- SSI (Supplemental Security Income)
		- Helps disabled children + adults
	- TANF (Temporary Aid to Needy Families)
		- Additional income for poor families
		- Requires people be working / looking for work + has time limits
	- EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit)
		- Provides tax rebates, effectively raising wage
- Food Stamps and Medical
	- SNAP / Food Stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)
		- Means-tested, in-kind
	- Medicaid
		- Means-tested, in-kind
		- Largely run by states, cutoff varies by state
		- Income cutoff expanded due to Affordable Care Act, but some resistant
	- Medicare
		- Not means-tested, in-kind
		- Has some premium adjustments by income
	- Question: For which of the following can one use SNAP benefits?
	  (a) Vitamins
	  (b) Frozen pizza
	  (c) A fresh rotisserie chicken
	  (d) All of the above
		- Frozen pizza
		  Explanation: SNAP cannot be used to by vitamins/medicines, so (a) is false. SNAP can be used to buy frozen pizzas, so (b) is true. SNAP can be used to buy poultry, but a fresh rotisserie chicken is likely not allowed to be purchased, so (c) is false. Since (a) and (c) are false, (d) is false. Thus, frozen pizza, which is (b) is the right answer.
