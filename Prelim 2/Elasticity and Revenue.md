## Notes

- Elasticity across the demand curve
  ![[Pasted image 20231003033604.png]]
	- Elastic/inelastic and quantity of demand
		- Elastic: quantity demand of product changes more than proportionally when price increases/decreases
		- Inelastic: quantity of demand changes very little
		- Unit elastic: % change in price = % change in demand
- Elasticity rules (**E - elasticity, PE - price equilibrium, QE - quantity equilibrium**) 
	- E < 1 (inelastic) --> | PE | > | QE |
		- P increases --> revenue increases, P decreases --> revenue decreases
		- P, revenue move together
	- E > 1 (elastic) --> | PE | < | QE |
		- P increases --> revenue decreases, P decreases --> revenue increases
		- P, revenue move in opposite directions
	- E = 1 (unit elastic) --> | PE | = | QE |
		- P increases, decreases --> revenue unchanged
	- Linear demand curves
		- E starts above 1 at lower Q, crosses 1, then goes below 1 at higher Q
- Total revenue calculation example
	- Between points A and B

		- Original TR is given by area of boxes x1, x2: `8 * 2 = 16`
		- New TR is given by area of boxes x2, x3: `6 * 4 = 24`
		- `24 > 16`, so as price ↑ revenue ↓ --> elastic (E starts above 1 at lower Q)
	- Between points C and D
	  ![[Pasted image 20231003120631.png]]
		- Original TR is given by area of boxes x1, x2: `4 * 6 = 24`
		- New TR is given by area of boxes x2, x3: `2 * 8 = 16` (rev. ↓ by $8)
		- `16 < 24`, so as price ↓ revenue ↓ --> inelastic (E goes below 1 at higher Q)
