## Notes

- 3 types of decision making in this chapter
	- either/or; marginal; sunk cost
- Decision terminology
	- Explicit vs implicit costs
		- Explicit: cost that requires outlay of money
		- Implicit: dollar value of benefits foregone as a result of choice
		- i.e. watching a movie
			- Explicit: $1.50 for rental, $2 for popcorn
			- Implicit: ~$15 given up for not working (assuming min. wage)
		- Like opportunity cost from earlier - opportunity includes explicit + implicit
		- Accounting profit vs economic profit
			- Accounting profit = revenue - explicit costs
			- Economic profit = revenue - (explicit costs + implicit costs)
- Economic profit example
	- Aluminum production is electricity intensive, so Kaiser Aluminum signed a multi-year deal @ 22.50 per megawatt hr for a factory in Cali
	- Electricity prices spiked in CA in summer of 2000
	- Price to sell back to grid was $555 megawatt-hr
		- Producing aluminum would yield accounting but NOT economic profit
			- Bcz must consider implicit cost of foregoing selling back to grid
	- KA realized economic profit importance --> shut down factory, sold power, paid employees full, and still made profit
- Decision type 1: either/or
	- Choosing b/w 2 decisions is common in life (go to college/work; buy vs lease)
	- Moral: When making either/or choice, pick that with greatest economic profit
	- Example: Starting a coffee shop vs $45,000/yr job
		- Coffee shop: startup costs ~ 200k (covered by CD with interest rate 5%), 1 employee, can sell business for 200k next yr if quit, research shows that I can make 50k in accounting profit
			- ***What would I choose?*
- Decision type 2: how many / how much?
	- Lots of daily decisions are marginal - push things out and see how much better
	- Goal: maximize economic profit
		- Means most profit as measured in units of dollars NOT most actual dollars
- Benefits
	- Marginal benefit
		- Benefit you get from 1 more unit
			- Just the next one, not all those before it
			- i.e. How much is 1 more hour of sleep worth to you?
		- So for next unit, MB = max WTP (willingness to pay)
		- Usually decreasing because people like variety
			- More of the same thing yields less and less benefits, can go negative
	- Total benefit
		- How much better off from consuming the quantity I pick
	- Average benefit
		- How much better off does each unit make me on avg?
- Costs
	- Marginal cost
		- Additional cost to acquire/produce 1 more of the good or service
			- Just the next one, not all those before it
		- Can be increasing, decreasing, or constant
			- Increasing --> take advantage of low hanging fruit first
			- Constant --> buying multiple units of same thing at same price
	- Total cost
		- How much did I have to give up for the quantity I pay
	- Average cost
		- How much, on avg, did each unit cost me?
	- Keep increasing quantity as long as **MB of next unit >= MC of next unit**
		- If MB = MC, go for it
- Example showing marginal benefit calculation![[Pasted image 20231004190146.png]] 
	- Do next total benefit - previous total benefit:
	  `35 - 20 = 15`
	  `45 - 35 = 10`
	  `50 - 45 = 5`
	  `53 - 50 = 3`
	  `52 - 53 = -1`
- Example #2 combining multiple cost + benefit concepts![[Pasted image 20231005160349.png]]
	- Marginal cost = current total cost - previous total cost
	- Marginal benefit = current total benefit - previous total benefit
	- Economic profit = total benefit  - total cost (respectively)
		- Formula: economic profit = revenue - (explicit costs + implicit costs)
