## Notes

- Taxes
	- Taxes are a financial charge on something
		- Used for revenue generation, behavior modification, fixing broken markets, etc.
	- Well-known forms
		- Income, capital gains, etc.
		- Sales
		- Tarrifs (charge on imports or exports)
	- "Excise taxes"
		- Tax on consumption of good or service (aka "consumption tax")
			- i.e. gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol taxes
			- Not quite standard sales tax
	- Can tax buyers or sellers 
		- Tax buyer
			- Buyer pays the price tag number + some tax per unit. Seller keeps price tag number, tax goes to govt
		- Tax seller
			- Buyer pays the price tag number. Seller keeps the price tag number - some tax per unit, which goes to govt
- Taxing sellers
	- After getting some price *P*, sellers pay tax portion *T*
		- Left with *P* - *T*
	- Supply curve tells us how much we will be supplied at a price
		- Price seen by supplier now lowered by T
		- At any given P, they will supply less
	- Supply curve will shift up T at all pts

- Above ex
	- Buyer sees the price P2, seller sees the price P2 - T
- Buyers and sellers see 2 different prices
	- Buyer price goes up, seller price goes down
	- Equilibrium quantity goes down
	- When taxing sellers, they pay part of the tax themselves, but buyers pay part of the tax as well
- Taxing buyers
	- Means buyers have to pay an extra cost T
		- They pay P + T 
	- Since price goes up, buyers will demand less
		- Demand curve will go down exactly T at all pts

- Above ex
	- Buyer sees the price P2 + T, seller sees the price P2
- Buyers and sellers see 2 diff prices again
	- Buyer price goes up, seller price goes down
	- Equilibrium quantity goes down
	- When taxing buyers, they pay part of the tax themselves, but the sellers pay part of the tax as well
- Result of comparing taxes on buyers and sellers
	- It does not matter who pays the tax, both sides pay some of it
		- *Incidence*: who bears the burden of the tax
	- Ending equilibrium outcome is the same
- Incidence
	- Buyers always pay TC and sellers pay TP, where T = TC + TP regardless of how tax is levied
		- We know who pays what percentage by relative elasticity
- Incidence and elasticity
	- More elastic -> more sensitive to price (price includes tax)
	- Less elastic -> less sensitive to price (price includes tax)
- Elastic supply, inelastic demand
![[Pasted image 20231018185637.png]]
- Elastic supply, elastic demand
![[Pasted image 20231018190330.png]]
- From above examples:
	- Price elasticity of demand > price elasticity of supply -> larger share paid by buyers
	- Price elasticity of supply > price elasticity of demand -> larger share paid by sellers
- The revenue side
	- How much tax does govt take in as result of an excise tax? (all below are the same)
		- Amount of tax / unit * num units
		- (Seller price - buyer price) * num units 
		- (Distance b/w supply and demand curve at equilibrium quantity) * equilibrium quantity
	- Tax revenue shown below

- Impact of changing tax
	- Effect of raising taxes on lowering/raising revenue depends on elasticities
		- Greater demand/supply elasticities -> more likely raising T lowers revenue
		- Lower demand/supply elasticities -> more likely raising T raises revenue
- Deadweight loss
	- There is loss from market distortion of the tax
		- We have lowered equilibrium quantity below what it would be if market was efficient

- Graphing taxes review
	- Excise tax drives "wedge" b/w price buyers see (increases) and price sellers see (decreases)
		- Lowers CS per unit by (new buyer price - old price)
		- Lowers PS per unit by (old price - new seller price)
		- Decreases CS and PS by removing transactions that would have occurred at old price
			- Some lost CS and PS goes to govt in revenue
				- Still surplus so this is a transfer, not a loss
				- But deadweight loss is a loss, NOT a transfer

- Other forms of the tax system
	- Every tax has 2 basic elements - tax base and structure
		- Tax base: value that determines tax
		- Tax structure: how tax depends on base
- Tax System
	- Proportional: Same % regardless of base value
	- Progressive: % rises with respect to base value
	- Regressive: % falls with respect to base value
- Efficiency vs equity
	- Per unit taxes distort quantity choices
	- Lump-sum taxes do not and so are more efficient -> can even avoid DWL
		- But can be unfair since they don't adjust due to compensation
		- Desire for equity pushes for benefit/ability-to-pay models
- Equity and progressive taxation
	- Federal income tax is progressive -> higher income means
		- (1) more taxes to be paid (as a number)
		- (2) larger percentage of income
	- Regressive -> state taxes, social security, medicare
	- In favor of progressive taxation -> fairness
	- Against progressive taxation -> distorting
		- Higher tax as income increases -> after tax earnings for each dollar get smaller
		- Rewards to higher income are decreased under progressive taxation
- Taxes in the US
	- Mean tax rates vs marginal tax rates
		- Mean: average tax rate paid on all income
		- Marginal: tax rate paid on next/last dollar earned
			- Make 250,001 is worse than making 249,999 if tax bracket ends at 250k -> some ppl called this silly during Obama administration
- Marginal vs Mean ex
	- For a single person:
		- Marginal tax rate if someone earning 70k earns 1 more dollar?
			- 22%
		- Mean tax rate if they earn 70k?
			- `0.10 * 11,000 + 0.12 * (44,725 - 11,000) + 0.22 * (70,000 - 44,725) = $10,707.5`. So then the rate is `10,707.5 / 70,000` which gives 15.3%
