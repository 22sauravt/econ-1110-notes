## Notes

- Taxes
	- Taxes are a financial charge on something
		- Used for revenue generation, behavior modification, fixing broken markets, etc.
	- Well-known forms
		- Income, capital gains, etc.
		- Sales
		- Tarrifs (charge on imports or exports)
	- "Excise taxes"
		- Tax on consumption of good or service (aka "consumption tax")
			- i.e. gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol taxes
			- Not quite standard sales tax
	- Can tax buyers or sellers 
		- Tax buyer
			- Buyer pays the price tag number + some tax per unit. Seller keeps price tag number, tax goes to govt
		- Tax seller
			- Buyer pays the price tag number. Seller keeps the price tag number - some tax per unit, which goes to govt
- Taxing sellers
	- After getting some price *P*, sellers pay tax portion *T*
		- Left with *P* - *T*
	- Supply curve tells us how much we will be supplied at a price
		- Price seen by supplier now lowered by T
		- At any given P, they will supply less
	- Supply curve will shift up T at all pts

- Above ex
	- Buyer sees the price P2, seller sees the price P2 - T
- Buyers and sellers see 2 different prices
	- Buyer price goes up, seller price goes down
	- Equilibrium quantity goes down
	- When taxing sellers, they pay part of the tax themselves, but buyers pay part of the tax as well
- Taxing buyers
	- Means buyers have to pay an extra cost T
		- They pay P + T 
	- Since price goes up, buyers will demand less
		- Demand curve will go down exactly T at all pts

- Above ex
	- Buyer sees the price P2 + T, seller sees the price P2
- Buyers and sellers see 2 diff prices again
	- Buyer price goes up, seller price goes down
	- Equilibrium quantity goes down
	- When taxing buyers, they pay part of the tax themselves, but the sellers pay part of the tax as well
- Result of comparing taxes on buyers and sellers
	- It does not matter who pays the tax, both sides pay some of it
		- *Incidence*: who bears the burden of the tax
	- Ending equilibrium outcome is the same
- Incidence
	- Buyers always pay TC and sellers pay TP, where T = TC + TP regardless of how tax is levied
		- We know who pays what percentage by relative elasticity
- Incidence and elasticity
	- More elastic -> more sensitive to price (price includes tax)
	- Less elastic -> less sensitive to price (price includes tax)
