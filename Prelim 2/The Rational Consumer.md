## Notes

- Utility 
	- Idea: take every possible combination of things you consume (food, free time, etc.)
	- Each bundle gives some amount of satisfaction
		- Map to a number using "utility function"
		- Assigns each bundle a number of "utils" of satisfaction
			- Bundles you like better -> more "utils"
	- Can vary by individual, as people like different things
	- Works great for comparing *within*, but not *across* individuals
		- Can't compare utility levels of 2 people
	- Is ordinal, not cardinal
		- Lets you rank choices, but beyond this utility number is useless
			- *Cannot* say: this choice gives me 2x the utility so I like it 2x as much
- Utility and Marginal Utility
	- Total utility -> satisfaction from a particular choice
	- Marginal utility can help make choice about quantity of something
		- How much time to sleep, books to read, cookies to eat, etc.
		- Marginal utility = change in utility from consuming 1 more of something
	- Ex: Emily vs my utility and marginal utility
		- *Can* say: Emily prefers 5 to 4 oreos, I prefer 6 to 7
		- *Cannot* say: 5 Oreos make Emily happier than they make me 
			- Because this is not ranking choices

- Marginal utility can be constant, increasing, or decreasing
	- Total utility usually rises with quantity, but can eventually fall
		- i.e. How many Oreos make me "happiest"?

- Constraints
	- Consuming more of anything has an opportunity cost
	- Money, time, and energy are limited so we must impose constraints
	- Can always simplify world to 2 goods - one good vs. everything else
	- Consumers have constraints
		- Can be time, income, etc. 
	- Want to express possible combinations they can choose, given constraints
		- Similar to PPF
	- Example
		- Take *I* - weekly income
			- Movies + books - movie spending + books spending <= *I*
			- Gives "budget constraint" (income *I* constrains my available choices)
			- Affordable bundles are "consumption possibilities" in "budget set"
	- Preview: goal is to reach highest utility within my constraint
- Mapping items to income
	- Like PPF, want to get budget line in opportunity costs form
		- Express costs in terms of the other good
	- Ex: Say weekly income is $100
		- Let P<sub>movies</sub> = 20 and P<sub>books</sub> = 10
			- Most movies I can afford per wk - 5
			- Most books I can afford per wk - 10
		- Budget line and budget set below:

- Ex. explanation: 
	- All points on or inside budget line are possible, others are not
		- Illustrates idea of trade off across goods + opportunity cost
	- To simplify life, assume:
		- No utility from saving money
		- No "satiation" - for any bundle, there is always a nearby that is preferred
	- Goal
		- Get consumption bundle that gives max utility *subject to budget constraint*
- Picking the optimal bundle
	- Optimal means most possible utility given constraint
	- We need to know how much utility we get from each bundle
		- Ignore any bundles outside budget line (not possible)
		- Don't want bundles inside budget line (not the best possible outcome)
	- Ex below
