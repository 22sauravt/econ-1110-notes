## Notes

- Utility 
	- Idea: take every possible combination of things you consume (food, free time, etc.)
	- Each bundle gives some amount of satisfaction
		- Map to a number using "utility function"
		- Assigns each bundle a number of "utils" of satisfaction
			- Bundles you like better -> more "utils"
	- Can vary by individual, as people like different things
	- Works great for comparing *within*, but not *across* individuals
		- Can't compare utility levels of 2 people
	- Is ordinal, not cardinal
		- Lets you rank choices, but beyond this utility number is useless
			- *Cannot* say: this choice gives me 2x the utility so I like it 2x as much
- Utility and Marginal Utility
	- Total utility -> satisfaction from a particular choice
	- Marginal utility can help make choice about quantity of something
		- How much time to sleep, books to read, cookies to eat, etc.
		- Marginal utility = change in utility from consuming 1 more of something
	- Ex: Emily vs my utility and marginal utility
		- *Can* say: Emily prefers 5 to 4 oreos, I prefer 6 to 7
		- *Cannot* say: 5 Oreos make Emily happier than they make me 
			- Because this is not ranking choices

- Marginal utility can be constant, increasing, or decreasing
	- Total utility usually rises with quantity, but can eventually fall
		- i.e. How many Oreos make me "happiest"?

- Constraints
	- Consuming more of anything has an opportunity cost
	- Money, time, and energy are limited so we must impose constraints
	- Can always simplify world to 2 goods - one good vs. everything else
	- Consumers have constraints
		- Can be time, income, etc. 
	- Want to express possible combinations they can choose, given constraints
		- Similar to PPF
	- Example
		- Take *I* - weekly income
			- Movies + books - movie spending + books spending <= *I*
			- Gives "budget constraint" (income *I* constrains my available choices)
			- Affordable bundles are "consumption possibilities" in "budget set"
	- Preview: goal is to reach highest utility within my constraint
- Mapping items to income
	- Like PPF, want to get budget line in opportunity costs form
		- Express costs in terms of the other good
	- Ex: Say weekly income is $100
		- Let P<sub>movies</sub> = 20 and P<sub>books</sub> = 10
			- Most movies I can afford per wk - 5
			- Most books I can afford per wk - 10
		- Budget line and budget set below:

- Ex. explanation: 
	- All points on or inside budget line are possible, others are not
		- Illustrates idea of trade off across goods + opportunity cost
	- To simplify life, assume:
		- No utility from saving money
		- No "satiation" - for any bundle, there is always a nearby that is preferred
	- Goal
		- Get consumption bundle that gives max utility *subject to budget constraint*
- Picking the optimal bundle
	- Optimal means most possible utility given constraint
	- We need to know how much utility we get from each bundle
		- Ignore any bundles outside budget line (not possible)
		- Don't want bundles inside budget line (not the best possible outcome)
	- Ex below
- Approaching picking the optimal bundle
	- Can graph all pts and check every single one, or approach logically
	- Since (1) constraint is income and (2) economists think on the margin
		- How much better off (in utility) does the next dollar spent on books make me? The next dollar spent on movies
		- Marginal utility per dollar
- Marginal utility per dollar
	- MU/P is decreasing as we consume more of a good
		- Price is constant, MU decreasing
		- More of something -> less utility we get by spending another dollar
	- Suggests people generally like variety
		- I'd rather have some movies + some books
		- Extremes are possible still - maybe someone hates movies
- Finding the optimal bundle
	- Taking a dollar from movies to spend on books makes sense if
		- MU/P for books > MU/P for movies
	- Taking a dollar from books to spend on movies makes sense if
		- MU/P for books < MU/P for movies
	- Do not shift money if neither condition above is true
		- Infinitely divisible goods means MU/P for books = MU/P for movies
			- Otherwise look for whole-point value as close as possible
	- Ex. below

- From utility to demand
	- What happens to optimal bundle when prices change?
		- Marginal utility doesn't change, but marginal utility per dollar does
		- Price increase -> MU/P goes down
		- Price decrease -> MU/P goes up
	- Ex: books and movies cont.
		- Let's say price of books goes up
		- Optimality means we must try to equate marginal utility per dollar
			- Higher price of books -> lower MU of books
				- So we must consume more movies since MU will get lower, and then MU/P will be lower
				- Know this because MU decreases as consumption increases
			- Consuming more movies means consuming fewer books
				- That increases MU because less consumption
			- So higher price -> lower demand, proving law of demand
- Splitting up effects on demand
	- Prices can change through 2 channels - relative prices + relative income
		- i.e. someone spending all income on burritos or coffee
- Substitution effect
	- Price increase makes burritos cheaper, even though sticker price won't change
	- When price of coffee rises, maximizing utility means substituting to burritos
		- Opportunity cost of coffee increased
		- Marginal utility per dollar of coffee decreases
		- Substituting away to burritos looks more desirable
- Income effect
	- Higher price of coffee means you feel your buying power has decreased
		- Change in "real income" due to price
		- Consider how budget constraint changes in when price changes
	- Plays a larger role when price increase is for
		- Items that make up a large share of spending
		- Items that don't have many substitutes
