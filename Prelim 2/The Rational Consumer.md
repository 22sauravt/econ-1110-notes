## Notes

- Utility 
	- Idea: take every possible combination of things you consume (food, free time, etc.)
	- Each bundle gives some amount of satisfaction
		- Map to a number using "utility function"
		- Assigns each bundle a number of "utils" of satisfaction
			- Bundles you like better -> more "utils"
	- Can vary by individual, as people like different things
	- Works great for comparing *within*, but not *across* individuals
		- Can't compare utility levels of 2 people
	- Is ordinal, not cardinal
		- Lets you rank choices, but beyond this utility number is useless
			- *Cannot* say: this choice gives me 2x the utility so I like it 2x as much
- Utility and Marginal Utility
	- Total utility -> satisfaction from a particular choice
	- Marginal utility can help make choice about quantity of something
		- How much time to sleep, books to read, cookies to eat, etc.
		- Marginal utility = change in utility from consuming 1 more of something
	- Ex: Emily vs my utility and marginal utility
		- *Can* say: Emily prefers 5 to 4 oreos, I prefer 6 to 7
		- *Cannot* say: 5 Oreos make Emily happier than they make me 
			- Because this is not ranking choices
